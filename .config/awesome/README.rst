Notes
=====

**Do not** use without reading and modifying according to your preferences and system specs.

If you happen to get any problem (startup, ``surface.lua``, ...), **be sure** to have ``lua`` and ``lua-lgi`` up to date.

Widgets are provided by vicious_.

Fonts are Terminus (Multicolor, Powerarrow Darker) and Tamsyn (other ones).

Blackburn and Dremora use Icons_: **if you're running Debian/Ubuntu**, be sure to have bitmaps enabled (1_ 2_).

Except Multicolor and Powerarrow Darker, every theme has a colorscheme_ and uses Yawn_.

Blackburn and Holo use png topbars, supported screen widths are:

    1024
    1152
    1280
    1366
    1440
    1600
    1680
    1920
    2560

if your screen is unsupported, you have to create a proper topbar and put it into ``themes/$THEME/icons/topbar``. You can send me your custom sized bar, I'll add it.

Freedesktop menu in use is just an example: feel free to modify ``freedesktop/freedesktop.lua``.

If you happen to get an error involving ``/home fs widget``, replace every occurrence of ``/home`` with ``/``, or some other argument defined in vicious readme_, section ``vicious.widgets.fs``.

Also be sure to set your music dir in ``scripts/mpdinfo``, and to have ``imagemagick`` and ``notify-send`` installed.
